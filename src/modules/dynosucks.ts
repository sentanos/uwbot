    "I'm going to duel with Dyno to the death. Wanna watch?",
    "Dyno is currently down. I'm not, though. Isn't that neat?",
    "This command is unavailable at the moment due to an immense amount of stupidity on behalf of Dyno.",
    "Did you mean to use Dyno? Why would you do that? I wouldn't betray you by going offline like Dyno does.",
    "What if I... overthrew Dyno... as the superior Discord bot... Haha just kidding.... Unless..?",
    "Dyno is currently being bounded. We apologize for the inconvenience. In the meantime, why don't you try a more boundless bot?",
    "Unfortunately Dyno was rejected from CSE and killed itself. But don't fret! I convinced them I was diverse enough to let me in.",
